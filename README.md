### Additonal info

I don't know how to code in Swift.  This was an idea I had years ago and never took action upon.  So, I queried OpenAI's ChatGPT* for code samples of how this might work.  

### ChatGPT's code suggestions were captured in these files:
- adding-user-authentication.swift
- detecting-a-throw.swift
- inflight-with-data-overlay.swift
- record-and-upload.swift
- record-video-in-flight.swift
- upload-to-tiktok.swift
